		content: 'This suject entails calculations that will enable the student have solid background on how to solve, arithmetics, surds, mathematical modelling, engineering mathematics, physics, chemistry, further mathematics, statistics. The student will have to go through rigorous exercises in the field in other to have a solid background on the fundamentals of mathematics. Mathematics is required in everyday life for smooth and easy running day to day activities. It is need in all spares of life, from the market to the industries',

		content: 'Physics a branch of engineering that deals with the study of nature in relation to energy, work and power. It studies how things moves and the reason behind the movement. With this the quest to know the underlying cause of this movement becomes very important which has lead to the study of motion, energy and power. in higher in stitutions, the study of physics has open the opportunities to study thermodynamics, mechanics, fuild dynamics, rotodynamics and lots more. We believe and study has proven that the study of physics is the cause of technology advancement. if we must continue to produce more modern technologies then we must continue to study complex physics',

		title: 'Mechanics of machines',

		content: 'This is a branch of applied physics that studies motions, static and dynamics behaviour of machines both on land and in air. Mechanics of machines is very tactical and should be taught by expert in the field of engineering most expectially physics oriented gurus who have passion for the subject and have undergone major projects in the field of mechanical engineering for effective teaching to the students. Note taht the more effective teaching we give to our learners the more they will advance our technology. We have to understand this and pay more attention in developing our learners so that they can in return develop the society',
